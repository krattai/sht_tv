For setting up broker, start with openstack, by way of KVM:
https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/installing-kvm-on-ubuntu-16-04-lts-server/

Put iso on system.

Install KVM:
sudo virt-install --virt-type=kvm --hvm --name odoosht0 --ram 1024 --vcpus=1 --os-type linux --os-variant ubuntu16.04 --cdrom=/home/sht/store/ubuntu-16.04.2-server-amd64.iso --network network=default,model=virtio --graphics vnc --disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/odoosht0.img,size=20,bus=virtio

update and upgrade

# not sure odoo is in here ...

broker and cdn should be running IPv6

Also, the host of KVM may best be running full services, a la
